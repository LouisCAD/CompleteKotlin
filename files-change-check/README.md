# files-changes-check

This directory contains a Kotlin script that checks that the filesthat we have in the [expected-files](expected-files) directory match the master branch of the Kotlin project on GitHub.

If these files change, it's likely that we need to update CompleteKotlin to work with newer Kotlin versions.
